- Completed UI/logic fixes for LogScorePopover:
  - Button layout now prevents overflow; both "Update Score" and "Cancel" fit within the popover.
  - Only relevant fields (time, reps, load, etc.) are shown for each workout type, reducing user confusion.
- Current focus: Continue polish and bugfixes for score logging and workout management.
- Next steps: Review other popover/modal components for similar layout or conditional rendering issues. Monitor user feedback for any edge cases in score logging UI.
