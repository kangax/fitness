**What works:**

- LogScorePopover UI is now clean: "Update Score" and "Cancel" buttons fit within the popover, no overflow.
- Only relevant fields are shown for each workout type (time, reps, load, etc.), improving clarity and reducing user error.

**What's left:**

- Review other popover/modal components for similar layout or conditional rendering issues.
- Continue polish and bugfixes for score logging and workout management.
- Monitor for edge cases or user feedback related to the new score logging UI.

**Current status:**

- Score logging UI is robust and user-friendly for standard workout types.
- No known issues with LogScorePopover after latest fixes.
