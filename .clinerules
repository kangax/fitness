# Project Guidelines

## General
- Do not leave comments of your changes (comments should only be used to explain why something is done, not what is done)
- Use meaningful commit messages after every task but ask user before commiting

## Code Style & Patterns

- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use repository pattern for data access
- Don't forget error handling

## Testing Standards

- Unit tests required for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
